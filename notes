Both experimental setup and stimuli will likely influence the type of gestures elicited from participants. 
In some studies \citep{Bangerter2004, DeRuiter2012}, participants sit facing a mutually visible  




producing descriptions of objects with more possible uses \citep{Masson-Carro2015}; producing lexically ambiguous speech \citep{Holler2003}






%what this study does
looks at speech-gesture relationship in dialogue. director/matching role swapping same items. 



%Gesture rate
One under-addressed issue in gesture research surrounds the exact measure of the relationship between speech and gesture
%JK examples = gesture N, duration, as a function of nr words, trial duration, or more uniquely 'feat. descriptions'/'semantic attirbutes'.

In speech, distinct phonemes and words, as well as the silence surrounding them, offer a clearly defined means of measuring utterance length and duration. 
Gestures, on the other hand, are less clear cut. 
Traditionally 
%JK(mcneill or kendon? look up)
, gesturing has been split into three main phases: Preparation; Stroke or Hold; and Retraction.
Like speech, gesture contain errors: False starts; repetitions; hangs (pauses). 
%JK the problem is objectively discerning between hangs and strokes. hangs and holds.

Any measure of gesture rate based on a duration which includes hangs should have as the denominator a measure of speech which includes pauses. 

So. gesture N. 
(like hands onset to hands offset)
But this is problematic as speakers may convey multiples pieces of information before putting hands down
esp. if needing to discern between iconics, beats etc.
de R - individual Gs = represent some feature of the target (e.g. shape, size)



What we suggest is a time spent iconically representing (or attempting to) a target in gesture / time spent referring to object.







Some studies looking at how 

Traditional measures of
Problems with measures of gesture rate.
n per minute \citep{Mol2011}
duration per trial \citep{Morsella2004}
n per 100 words \citep{Masson-Carro2015, Hostetter2007, Gerwing2011, Hoetjes2015} 
n per "feature descriptions" \citep{DeRuiter2012}/"attributes" \citep{Hoetjes2015}
distribution of information \citep{Gerwing2011} - split features of stimulus (a picture of a woman) into parts. look at "proportions of contributed information".
what info is included/excluded given presence of gesture \citep{Melinger2004}

discerning individual gestures isn't a clearly defined process \citet{DeRuiter2012} codes a gesture as corresponding to a movement "illustrating a feature of the target (for instance its shape).". \citet{Hoetjes2015} do something similar.
